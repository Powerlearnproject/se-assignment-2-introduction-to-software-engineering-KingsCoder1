Testing helps ensure software meets requirements, works as expected, and is reliable, stable, and secure. It's an essential step in the software development process.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
ATTEMPT: Version control systems (VCS) are tools used in software development to manage changes to source code over time. They track modifications to files, allowing developers to collaborate effectively, revert to previous versions, and maintain a history of changes. 

One popular VCS is Git, known for its distributed nature, speed, and flexibility. It enables branching and merging, facilitating parallel development workflows. GitHub and GitLab are platforms built around Git, offering additional collaboration features like issue tracking and code review.

Another widely used VCS is Subversion (SVN), which follows a centralized model. It maintains a single repository for the project, making it easier to manage access control and permissions.

Mercurial is another distributed VCS similar to Git, offering comparable features but with a different command-line interface and workflow.

Features common to VCS include:
- Tracking changes: Recording modifications made to files, including who made the changes and when.
- Branching and merging: Allowing developers to work on isolated features or fixes without affecting the main codebase, then integrating changes back into the main branch.
- Collaboration: Enabling multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently, with mechanisms for resolving conflicts.
- History tracking: Maintaining a log of all changes made to the codebase, facilitating auditing and debugging.
- Rollback: Reverting to previous versions of files or the entire codebase in case of errors or unwanted changes.
